  <!-- the ''<p></p>'' is used to convert txt to paragraphs in html. just so you know, we use the <<i></i> or <<em></em> to italacize our text in html.
the <<em></em> should be used often as it relays stress on the word that is being italacized. it also conveys more meaning whenever we use the <em></em>.
the <strong></strong> and bold tag are used to make a text bold but the strong tag tells our browser that the text enclosed in the tag is of great importance,
and should be treated as such. For us to be able to list things with bullet points, we use the ''<ul></ul> ul means unorderd list.tag followed by the '<li></li>' tag
which is used to organize things in bullet form. for us to be ablr to list stuffs in an orderly manner other than an unordered manner using bullet points,
we can use the <ol></ol>  tag which means 'ordered list', it will number our list in an ascending order. We also use the <img src="" alt=""> to insert an
image in our website. Just so you know , we use the <a href="URL LINK STAYS HERE"> TEXT TO REPRESENT LINK STAYS HERE.</a> which is known as the anchor tag to add links to a text in html. where the 'herf ' attribute
in the anchor tag is where the link wiil stay and after the closing of the opening tag and before the closing tag we will put the text we want to represent the link.-->
